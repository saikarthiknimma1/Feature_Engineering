# CIFAR-10 Image Classification


This code file helps in diving into several machine learning techniques that can be used to classify CIFAR-10 images 

## Project Overview

This project mainly executes the procedure of classifying the 10 categories of images in the CIFAR-10 dataset, where every 32x32-color image can be classified into:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter notebook includes:

### 1. Data Exploration
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Sample visualizations
- Class distribution
- Correlation among RGB channels

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Traditional computer vision features:
  - Histogram of Gradients HOG
  - Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
  - Color histograms
- Deep learning features using pretrained models:
  - VGG-16
  - ResNet-50 

### 3. Model Implementations
- Machine learning classifiers:
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
- Neural network approaches:
  - Custom CNN architecture
  - Transfer learning with ResNet-50

### 4. Evaluation
- Model performance comparison
- Training progress visualization
- Prediction analysis
